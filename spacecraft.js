/* Task 1: No Parameters: Activate Hyperdrive */
// TODO: Write an arrow function named `activateHyperdrive` with no parameters that print `"Hyperdrive activated!"` to the console. Call `activateHyperdrive` to test it.

/* Task 4: Understanding `this`: Message from Home Base */
// TODO: Inside an object named `spacecraft`, create a method named `receiveMessage` using arrow function syntax. This method should log `"Message received: "` followed by a message it receives as a parameter. Directly call `receiveMessage` within `spacecraft` and observe. Observe and explain the behavior of `this` in this context as a comment.

/*
 * Observations: Console.log prints "undefined" for `this.name` because arrow functions do not have their own `this` context.
 * Instead, they inherit `this` from the parent scope at the time they are defined.
 * In this case, `this` does not refer to the `spacecraft` object.
